State of the Art of Extensible  Records in Functional Languages

This is my bachelor thesis. It's a survey on existing extensible records in functional languages and also explores the concept of kind system.
The programming languages used are Scala, Ocaml, F# and Haskell.
In my paper I also highlight both the good sides and shortcomings of the extensible record structure and it's implementations.
